# Portfolio Assignment from Analysis of Algorithms (Dec 2020)
My portfolio/final project from my Analysis of Algorithms (CS 325) class. Not edited since it was submitted in December 2020.

## Assignment Instructions:

- Choose one of the 24 puzzles in the PDF (not included in this repository) or create your own puzzle!
- Use the most appropriate algorithm method from our course to solve the decision problem in the paper. (You only are required one algorithm that verifies the players solution is viable against the possible puzzle instances). Players should be able to enter their own attempt at a solution. 
- Create the code for that game as well as a brief description of the rules and a reference to its time complexity. A GUI playable game is not required, but you are welcome to do so. Pygame is a good choice for this in Python. 
- You will also need to prove a summarization of your solution to show proof of your method usage, that you will include in your PDF.
- Prove your algorithm used for the decision of the problem from the paper rather than trying to prove your game or puzzle of choice. You want to prove the solution either is or is not NP Complete
